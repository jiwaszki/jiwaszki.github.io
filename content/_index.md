## What is *jiwaszki*?

Hi, I’m Jan Iwaszkiewicz (jiwaszki) – an engineer who loves Python/C++/C, optimizing performance, and building AI/ML solutions. I’m also drawn to embedded development and enjoy exploring open-source projects and finding smarter ways to streamline workflows. Outside of engineering, I’m passionate about comics, animations, and computer graphics, where creativity meets technology.
